# Contributing

## SAP CX Tools Contributor License Agreement

- You will only submit contributions where you have authored 100% of the content.
- You will only submit contributions to which you have the necessary rights. This means that if you are employed you
  have received the necessary permissions from your employer to make the contributions.
- Whatever content you contribute will be provided under the project license(s).

### Project Licenses

- All modules use [GNU General Public License v3.0](LICENSE.md).

## Commit Messages

As a general rule, the style and formatting of commit messages should follow the guidelines in
[How to Write a Git Commit Message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).

In addition, any commit that is related to an existing issue must reference the issue. For example, if a commit in a
pull request addresses issue \#999, it must contain the following at the bottom of the commit message.

```
Issue: #999
```

## Pull Requests

Our definition of done offers some guidelines on what we expect from a pull request. Feel free to open a pull request
that does not fulfill all criteria, e.g. to discuss a certain change before polishing it, but please be aware that we
will only merge it in case the DoD is met:

- There are no TODOs left in the code
- Method preconditions are checked and documented in the method's Javadoc
- Coding conventions (e.g. for logging) have been followed
- Change is covered by automated tests
- Public API has Javadoc
- Change is documented in user guide and release notes
- All continuous integration builds pass

Please add the following lines to your pull request description:

## Coding Conventions

### Naming Conventions

Whenever an acronym is included as part of a type name or method name, keep the first letter of the acronym uppercase
and use lowercase for the rest of the acronym. Otherwise, it becomes _impossible_ to perform camel-cased searches in
IDEs, and it becomes potentially very difficult for mere humans to read or reason about the element without reading
documentation (if documentation even exists).

Consider for example a use case needing to support an HTTP URL. Calling the method `getHTTPURL()` is absolutely
horrible in terms of usability; whereas, `getHttpUrl()` is great in terms of usability. The same applies for types
`HTTPURLProvider` vs. `HttpUrlProvider`, etc.

Whenever an acronym is included as part of a field name or parameter name:

- If the acronym comes at the start of the field or parameter name, use lowercase for the entire acronym -- for
  example, `String url;`.
- Otherwise, keep the first letter of the acronym uppercase and use lowercase for the rest of the acronym -- for
  example, `String defaultUrl;`.

### Formatting

#### Code

Code formatting is enforced using the [Spotless](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless) Gradle plugin. You can use
`gradle spotlessApply` to format new code and add missing license headers to source files. Formatter and import order
settings for Eclipse are available in the repository under [conventions/eclipse-formatter-settings.xml](conventions/eclipse-formatter-settings.xml)
and [conventions/eclipse.importorder](conventions/eclipse.importorder), respectively. For IntelliJ IDEA there's a
[plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6546) you can use in conjunction with the Eclipse settings.

#### Documentation

Text in `*.md` files should be wrapped at 120 characters whenever technically possible.

In multi-line bullet point entries, subsequent lines should be indented.

### Spelling

Use American English spelling rules when writing documentation as well as for code -- class names, method names, variable names, etc.

### Javadoc

- Javadoc comments should be wrapped after 80 characters whenever possible.
- This first paragraph must be a single, concise sentence that ends with a period (".").
- Place `<p>` on the same line as the first line in a new paragraph and precede `<p>` with a blank line.
- Insert a blank line before at-clauses/tags.
- Favor `{@code foo}` over `<code>foo</code>`.
- Favor literals (e.g., `{@literal @}`) over HTML entities.
- New classes and methods should have `@since ...` annotation.
- Use `@since 5.0` instead of `@since 5.0.0`.
- Do not use `@author` tags. Instead, contributors are listed on [GitHub](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/graphs/contributors).
- Do not use verbs in third person form (e.g. use "Discover tests..." instead of "Discovers tests...")
  in the first sentence describing a method.

### Tests

#### Naming

- All test classes must end with a `Tests` suffix.

#### Assertions

- Use AssertJ when assertions are needed.
- Do not use `org.junit.Assert` or `junit.framework.Assert`.

#### Mocking

- Use either [Mockito](https://github.com/mockito/mockito) or hand-written test doubles.

### Logging

- In general, logging should be used sparingly.
- All logging must be performed via the SLF4j `Logger` fa√ßade provided via the SLF4j [LoggerFactory](https://www.slf4j.org/manual.html).
- Log levels and their usage.
  - `ERROR`: extra information (in addition to an Exception) about errors that will halt execution
  - `WARN`: potential usage or configuration errors that should not halt execution
  - `INFO`: information the users might want to know but not by default
  - `DEBUG`: information the developers might want to know to understand execution
