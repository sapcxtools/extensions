All extensions available in this repository are built with high test coverage and do not influence the behavior of
your project without changes to your configuration. This is guaranteed and intended by design, because the extensions
give the full control of functionality into the hands of the project teams. Our coding conventions and code reviews
follow high standards and decline features, that will change the standard behavior without activating them via a
configuration parameter.
